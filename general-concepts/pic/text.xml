<p>
On some architectures, shared libraries must be built with <c>-fPIC</c>.
On <c>x86</c> and others, shared libraries may build without <c>-fPIC</c>.
This can be wasteful and potentially cause a performance hit.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter a package that is not building shared libraries with
<c>-fPIC</c>, patch the Makefile to build only the shared libraries with
<c>-fPIC</c>. More information on PIC is available at the
<uri link="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened/Position_Independent_Code_internals">
PIC internals</uri> wiki page. If you are unsure, please ask in a public
developer forum (like the <c>gentoo-dev</c> mailing list or the
<c>#gentoo-dev</c> IRC channel) for help.
