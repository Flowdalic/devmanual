<title>Configuring XEmacs for UTF-8</title>
<body>

<p>
XEmacs has built-in Unicode support since version 21.5. It is recommended to
start XEmacs from within a UTF-8 locale which will control the default coding
system.
</p>

<p>
If automatic character set detection on files is not working properly,
here are three commands that can help.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <c>set-buffer-file-coding-system (C-x RET f)</c> changes the coding
    system for the current file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <c>set-default-buffer-file-coding-system (C-x RET F)</c> sets the default for
    unsaved buffers and ASCII-looking files that have no obvious character
    set markers for autodetection.
  </li>
  <li>
    <c>universal-coding-system-argument (C-x RET c)</c>
    lets you set the coding system for the next command, so issuing
    this from a dired window immediately before opening a problematic file
    is a tactic that can be of use when autodetection gets things
    pathologically wrong.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The current coding system will be displayed near the left edge of the
status line.
